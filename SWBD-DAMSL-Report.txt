ANS- I have used 1. baseline_crf.py 2. advanced_crf.py 3. evaluate_model.py. The hw3_corpus_tool.py is modified in baseline_crf.py and advanced_crf.py


2. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features
ANS- I have used evaluate_model.py to identify the accuracy for each of the additional features that I have added.

I manually selected 25% of the files for evaluating the model in a seperate directory and 75% of data to for development in separate folder.
